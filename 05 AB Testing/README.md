## Overview  
Conduct an A/B Testing by Survey method on surveying whether you prefer a smartphone with a rounded edge or a square edge.    
  
Since Apple released the iPhone 12, there has been much debate as iPhones revert to the square edge format. Some people like rounded edges. Hence the origin of this survey.
